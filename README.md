Detecting Coastal Wetland Degradation by Combining Remote Sensing and Hydrologic Modeling

1. NDVI images from Landsat 5, 7, and 8
2. Hydrologic simulations of groundwater tables and saltwater tables from PIHM-wetland

Groundwater table and saltwater table simulation outputs from the PIHM-Wetland model are available on reasonable request from the corresponding author due to that they are prohibitively large to store in a repository.
