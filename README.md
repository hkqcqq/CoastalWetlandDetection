# CoastalWetlandDetection

Detecting Coastal Wetland Degradation by Combining Remote Sensing and Hydrologic Modeling

1. NDVI iamges from Landsat 5, 7, and 8
2. Hydrologic simulations of groundwater tables and saltwater tables from PIHM-wetland


Hydrologic simulations are too big to be uploaded. The data are available on request from Keqi He (keqi.he@duke.edu).
